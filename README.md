#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering Is the application of engineering principles to develop quality and beneficial software for system. It compasses the whole process of design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. 
Importance - It helps create high quality software that meet the needs of users the technology industry. My stones

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Development of programming language: In the early 1950, Codes were written in one and zero. In 1953 John Backus democratized computer programming by providing Scientists the ability to input their problem directly into the computer without relying on a program to translate their needs into  the machine.

2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960: As computers became  more complex, the need for specialized software developers became apparent. This led to the birth of software engineering as a distinct discipline. 

3. The rise of agile Methodologies in 2000: The agile methodology originated in the software development industry as a new way to manage software development. Many software development project were failing or taking too long to complete. The industry leaders realized the need to find a new Innovative approach. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of software development life cycle are : 
1. Requirements: this involves a little research to gather put user assistant needs. 
2. Design: The next step is to create a design of software architecture and the user face. 
3. Implementation: This follows the design step it informs writing codes according to the design. 
4. Testing: testing the codes to see if it meets both standard and functional requirements. 
5. Deployment: releasing the software to users. 
6. Maintenance: continuously improving the software by providing support and updates. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Is step by step process where instead is completed before the next starts You can't go back easily. You gather  requirements, design code, test code and launch. 
Agile : Is a flexible process where work is done in small cycle called ‘Sprints’ Feedback is used to make adjustments.
B. Examples:
Waterfall - Develop a software for managing employee records where all requirements are known upfront. 
Agile - Develop a social networking app where request might change often, you build in small parts, tests it, get feedback and improve the app in each cycle. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer design, writes, and maintains code to build software.
2. A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software is free from defect and meet the required quality standards.
3. A project manager oversee the entire software development process to ensure it is completed on time and within scope

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development environment IDE is a software tool that provides everything needed to write, test, and debug code in one place. it's importance is that it streamline the development process by combining code, editing, debugging, and compiling, in a single interface. 
example is the visual code studio where you can write code run it and fix errors or within one program

version control system VCS is a tool that tracks and manages changes to code over time. it's importance is that it allows multiple developers to work on the same Project, it also allows developers to go back to previous version is something goes wrong. example is Git which helps team collaborate, track changes and manage project efficiently. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
common challenges faced by software engineers are ;changing requirement, tight deadline, and technical debts. Some strategies to overcome this challenges are; efficient communication, prioritization of task, agile methodology, regular assessment of timelines and project goals. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing: Ensures individual components of the software works correctly, this helps catch small issues early on saving time and efforts.
2. integration testing: ensures that different components work well together this help identify issue that arise when combining part of the software
3. system testing: test the complete software to ensure its function as expected is ensures the overall system into design requirement
4. acceptance testing: confirms the software meat user requirement it is a final step before the release to ensure softwares ready for use. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promot engineering is the process of designing and refining instructions of prompt given to AI model to get accurate and useful result. 
it importance are;
maximizing accuracy
Saving Time 
controlling outcomes

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt engineering: define software engineering
improved prompts engineering: define software engineering in simple words to a beginner adults citing examples of the work software engineers do. 
the improved point is effective because it serves the purpose of why they prompt was created and a safe time.
